# 1--Projects-from-my-own-mind.
Here I will show projects that was created without research and help from others. The intention is to show my internal knowledge of JAVA and progress.
At the moment this is all I can do in Java due to my intense study and work routine (Not in the code area), but I put all my knowledge and creativity into this small project.
