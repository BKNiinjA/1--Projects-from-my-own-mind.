# 1--Projects-from-my-own-mind.
Here I will show projects that was created without research and help from others. The intention is to show my internal knowledge of JAVA and progress.
At the moment this is all I could do in Java due to my intense study and work routine (Not in the code area), but I put all my knowledge and creativity into this small project.
My intention with this project was to make a skydiver building, which had apartments, a weather sensor and a way to organize the skydiver in line to jump from the building's heliport.
All this with a single main activation in the main class.
